## Description:
### This project has the ability to help you organize a business department, roles, employees, etc. 
### For this content management system I use Inquirer and mysql2 imported. I created schema, seeds, and query sql files to separate functionality to make it easier to read and edit. I also use some Javascript to create functions that prompt for questions and answers as well as taking the corresponding answers and appending them to the database.
